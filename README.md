# MNE Wordlist GSoc 2025
# Wordlist Scoring System ðŸ§ ðŸ“š

This project is a part of my GSoC 2025 proposal under the **MNE-Python** organization.

## ðŸ“Œ Objective

The goal is to develop a scoring system for wordlists that can be used in cognitive neuroscience experiments, especially those based on the MNE-BIDS pipelines.  
The scoring helps researchers choose balanced word sets for memory and language tasks.

## ðŸ“Š Features

- Count total letters, unique letters, and unique vowels
- Add bonus points for high-vowel words
- Save wordlist + scores as CSV

## ðŸ’¡ Next Steps

- Add more linguistic features (e.g., word frequency, syllable count, concreteness)
- Normalize scores across languages and datasets
- Integrate with MNE-BIDS pipelines for experimental design use-cases
